# Project Title: Movie Rating and Genre Prediction Using Network Science Assisted by Machine Learning
Description: This project aims to leverage network science and machine learning techniques to predict movie ratings and genres using the IMDB dataset. With a dataset comprising 25,000 movies, we will explore and analyze various network characteristics and apply different machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, we will utilize cosine similarity for genre and rating predictions without relying on machine learning models.

Genre Prediction Using Machine Learning Models:

Implement various ML models such as K-Means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Model. Utilize network-based sub-network clusters to predict genres. Movie Rating Prediction Using Machine Learning Models:

Implement supervised models such as Linear Regression to predict movie ratings. Genre Prediction Using Cosine Similarity:

Predict genres of movies without using machine learning models. Movie Rating Prediction Using Cosine Similarity:

Predict movie ratings without using machine learning models.
